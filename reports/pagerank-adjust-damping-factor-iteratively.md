## [Effect of stepwise adjustment of Damping factor upon PageRank][report]

> While doing research work with [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli], and [Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee].

**Abstract** — The effect of adjusting damping factor α, from a small initial value α0 to the final desired αf value, upon then iterations needed for PageRank computation is observed. Adjustment of the damping factor is done in one or more steps. Results show no improvement in performance over a fixed damping factor based PageRank.

**Index terms** — PageRank algorithm, Step-wise adjustment, Damping factor.
