In graph theory, a graph representation is a technique to store graph into the
memory of computer. To represent a graph, we just need the set of vertices, and
for each vertex the neighbors of the vertex (vertices which is directly
connected to it by an edge). If it is a weighted graph, then the weight will be
associated with each edge. [(1)]
